YOLOv5 CNN Model for Mars Carters Datasets
This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model implemented using YOLOv5 for the purpose of object detection in Mars Carters datasets.

Introduction
Mars Carters datasets are a collection of images taken by cameras mounted on rovers and satellites sent to explore Mars. These datasets contain a wide variety of objects, including rocks, dust, and other geological features.

Object detection is an important task in the analysis of these datasets, as it allows researchers to identify and classify different objects in the images. This can provide valuable information about the geology and composition of Mars.

Model Description
The CNN model in this repository is implemented using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. YOLOv5 is a fast and accurate object detection method that is well suited for real-time applications.

The model has been trained on a large dataset of images from Mars Carters datasets, and is able to detect a wide range of objects in these images. The model has been evaluated on a separate test set, and has achieved high accuracy and robust performance.

Getting Started
To use the model, you will need to install the necessary dependencies and download the model weights.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
PyTorch 1.5 or higher
OpenCV
Numpy
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/yolov5-mars-carters-cnn.git
Navigate to the root directory of the repository:
Copy code
cd yolov5-mars-carters-cnn
Install the required Python packages:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the model weights from the following link and save them in the weights directory: Link to model weights
Usage
To use the model, you can use the provided detect.py script. This script takes an image file as input and outputs a new image with the detected objects labeled.

Here is an example of how to use the script:

Copy code
python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
This will output a new image output.jpg in the current directory, with the detected objects labeled.
